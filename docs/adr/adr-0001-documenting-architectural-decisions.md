# Documenting architectural decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

To maintain a clear and accessible history of important architectural decisions throughout the project development, a structured method of documentation is required. This facilitates understanding of the rationale behind choices, promotes transparency, and aids future collaborators in grasping the reasons for decisions made.

## Considered Options

- **No documentation:** Simple but results in loss of knowledge and difficulty in maintenance.
- **Using ADRs:** Structured, version-controlled, easily searchable and maintained close to the code.

## Decision Outcome

We will adopt the ADR (Architecture Decision Records) pattern to record all relevant architectural decisions of this project. ADR files will be stored under the `docs/adr` directory within the repository.

## Consequences

- Clear, traceable history of decisions.
- Facilitates onboarding and future reviews.
- Improves team communication.
- Requires discipline to keep updated.
- Initial overhead to write ADRs.
